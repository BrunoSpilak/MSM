Description : 'Plots the average of n Bernoulli trials (each taking a 
               value of +/- 1, with probability 0.5) to show the law 
               of large numbers and the law of the iterated logarithm.
               Plots of sample mean (red), its asymptotic standard 
               deviation (dark-green) and its bound given by law of iterated
               logarithm (blue).'
